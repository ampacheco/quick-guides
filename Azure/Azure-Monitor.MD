# Azure Monitoring

## Data Sources

1. Data from applications.
1. Data from the various operating systems running in Azure.
1. Information fed from Azure resources, subscriptions, and tenants.
1. Custom data. If youâ€™d like to send in monitoring-related data from your systems or applications, basically of any sort and from any source, Azure Monitor can take in that custom data.

## Data Types

The data that comes into Azure Monitor can be divided into two types:

**Metrics:** Small numerical pieces of information from counters, gauges, and so forth that are collected on a regular basis.

**Log data:** Information gathered from many different logs, such as Windows event logs, Linux syslog, agents running on virtual machines, custom logs, telemetry from Application Insights, and more.

In this module, we will be focusing primarily on log data.

## What we can do with Data

Once the data is in Azure Monitor, there is a suite of tools that will let us analyze, visualize, respond to specific contents, and integrate that data with other tools.
